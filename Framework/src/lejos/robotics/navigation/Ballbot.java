/**
 * <p>This class dynamically stabilizes a ballbot type of robot. The ballbot robot uses two motors to drive a ball
 * with a similar configuration to a mechanical mouse.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A ballbot needs good motors, sensors, a grippy ball/rollers (wheels) and should be as symmetrical as possible in all
 * directions (like a circle) to optimize stability. If using a billiard ball or LEGO ball, it is recommended
 * to apply a layer of rubber glue to the tires to add grip.</p> 
 * 
 * <p>To start the robot balancing:
 * <li>1. Run the program. You will be prompted to lay it down.
 * <li>2. Lay it down (orientation doesn't matter). When it detects it is not moving it will automatically calibrate the gyro sensors.
 * <li>3. When the beeping begins, stand it up on the ball so it is vertically balanced.
 * <li>4. When the beeping stops, let go and it will begin balancing on its own.</p>
 * 
 * <p><i>This code is based on the Segoway class.</p>
