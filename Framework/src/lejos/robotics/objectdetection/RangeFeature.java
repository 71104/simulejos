/**
 * <p>This class is a basic data container for information retrieved about an object detected by
 * sensors. The RangeFeature contains only the most basic range information of a detected object, which
 * is {@link RangeReading}. The RangeReading contains range and angle data <i>relative</i> to the robot.</p>
 * 
 * <p>It can be extended to include more information, such as color. For example, a ColorFeature would 
 * rely on a ColorFeatureDetector to supply color information and range. The ColorFeatureDetector could extend
 * FeatureDetector and accept a camera in the constructor to identify color of a detected object. This type of 
 * class would be useful to allow soccer robots to identify team-mates, the soccer ball, and the different goals.</p>
