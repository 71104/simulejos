 * TODO: Testing:
 * 1. See how code looks to make a range sensor proportionally rotate left or right when doing an arc.
 * More of a move listener thing maybe, but needs to see the angle.
 * 2. Implement a bumper navigator and echo navigator sample.
 * 3. See how easy it is to react differently based on criteria (such as person ID - chase or run away depending on person). 
 * 4. Implement this API in PathPlanner/PathController. Will need setFeatureDetector() and alt constructor.

/**
 * <p>A FeatureDetector is capable of detecting objects and notifying listeners when it detects something. A Feature is
 * a term for any property that can be added to map data. The FeatureListener is notified when an object is detected,
 * even if it has previously detected the same object.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The most basic feature is the Range Feature, which indicates the position of the detected object relative
 * to the "center" of the robot (normally the point mid-way between the drive wheels). A robot with many bumpers
 * arrayed around the robot will also report the bumper location relative to the robot center.</p>
 * 
 * <p>There can be many different qualities recorded by different FeatureDetector implementations. For example, you could
 * implement a VectorFeatureDetector that could take multiple readings of an object, determine any change in position, 
 * and return the velocity/vector of the object (provided the sensor is capable of identifying an object and change in 
 * position). For example, a camera could note the change in position of objects and estimate the vector/velocity of 
 * the object.</p>
 * 
 * <p><i>Note: Because {@link FeatureListener#featureDetected(Feature, FeatureDetector)} and {@link FeatureDetector#scan()} are
 * only capable of returning a Feature object, any classes that want to read extended feature qualities (e.g.
 * vector, color, or person data) would need to use an instanceof test to see if it is the appropriate data container,
 * then cast the object into that type in order to retrieve the unique data.</i></p>

 * @author BB based on concepts by Lawrie Griffiths
