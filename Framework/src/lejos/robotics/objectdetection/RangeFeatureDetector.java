/*
 * DEVELOPER NOTES:

 * TODO: One weakness of this class is it forces RangeFinder to use multiple readings. Might be some benefits to only
 * retrieving one reading from ultrasonic sensor.

/**
 * <p>The RangeFeatureDetector used a RangeFinder to locate objects (known as features when mapping). This class is
 * unable to identify the feature and merely reports the range and angle to the object.</p>
 * 
 *  <p>You can also have the scan identify the object (such as a camera using facial recognition to identify a person).
 *  One possibility to implement this is to extend RangeFeatureDetector and add a camera to the constructor. When the
 *  FeatureDetector range scanner detects an object, take a picture and look for a face in the image. This is then
 *  reported as an extended class of RangeFeature called PersonFeature, which has a getPerson() method containing 
 *  information on the object that was detected.</p>
 *  
 * <p>To create a more complex FeatureDetector, extend this class and override the {@link FeatureDetector#scan()} method.
 * It is possible to add more complex functionality in this method, such as only returning a "hit" if the scanner detects
 * an object in the same location twice in a row. This type of filtering could also take place in the FeatureListener
 * method, although then single {@link FeatureDetector#scan()} calls will not contain the filtering.</p>
