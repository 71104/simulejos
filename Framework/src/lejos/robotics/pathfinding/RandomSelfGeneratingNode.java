/**
 * This Node is able to randomly generate its own neighbors via the getNeighbors() method. The number of neighbors 
 * and possible distances to the neighbors are determined in the constructor. The first instance of this node is generally
 * the start node used in algorithms. The goal node is just a regular node that is automatically linked to this set
 * when the dynamically created nodes come within range of the goal node.
 * Note: Because the nodes are randomly generated, there is no guarantee they will come within range of the goal node
 * and successfully link up. However, in practice they will always connect if you use enough connections (minimum 3-4) and 
 * a long enough maxDist.
