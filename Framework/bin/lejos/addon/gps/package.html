<body>The lejos.addon.gps package provides GPS parsing. In most cases you probably 
want to use the package {@link javax.microedition.location}, which is the standard 
Java API for obtaining GPS data.  That package is built on top of the classes in this 
package.<p>
Additionally, this package offers more data, such as satellite information.</body>
